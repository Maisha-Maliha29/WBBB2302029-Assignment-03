Some of these foods are french fries, steak, pasta, and especially pizza.

The toppings can vary depending on one's preference, and they can range from vegetables like bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms to meat like pepperoni, sausage, and chicken.</dd>
        <dt><a href="#fries">French fries</a></dt>
            <dd>I like to eat and make French fries.French fries (North American English), chips (British English and other national varieties), finger chips (Indian English), french-fried potatoes, or simply fries, are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes of disputed origin from Belgium or France. They are prepared by cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them, usually in a deep fryer. Pre-cut, blanched, and frozen russet potatoes are widely used, and sometimes baked in a regular or convection oven; air fryers are small convection ovens marketed for frying potatoes.</dd>
